<div class="body judges-index"><h1 id="scoring">Judging &amp; Scoring</h1><p>We spent a lot of time thinking about how to keep Node.js Knockout judging
fun, fair, and exciting.  Here's how it’s going to work:</p>

<h3>Voting</h3>

<p>There will be two groups of voters: <strong>expert judges</strong> and the <strong>general
public</strong>.</p>

<p>All voting will take place at the same time: between 03:00 GMT on Monday,
August 30 and 0:00 GMT on Friday, September 3.</p>

<h4>Expert Voting</h4>

<p>We have an <a href="#judges">amazing and diverse panel of expert judges</a> who are
volunteering their time to provide thoughtful feedback on your weekend’s
work.</p>

<p>Each expert judge will be asked to review an initial batch of 5-10 entries.
After they do their initial batch, judges will be encouraged to review
a handful more of the top entries that pique their interest.  Experts will
not be allowed to vote for people who they know.</p>

<p>In order to ensure all expert judges are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring">anchoring</a> similarly, they will
be asked to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_on_a_curve">grade along a curve</a> with a mean of 3.5.</p>

<p>The hope is that this will allow every entry to get at least 2-3 thoughtful
expert reviews and that the best entries will get enough reviews that the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">law of large numbers</a> ensures fairness.</p>

<h4>Public Voting</h4>

<p>Any member of the general public may vote.  You are encouraged to get as many
people as possible to vote for your entry. Voting will be very easy (yes, your
mom will be able to do it).</p>

<p>General public voters must meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul><li>They need a valid e-mail address (we will ask them to verify their
votes by e-mail).</li><li>They need to vote for at least 5 entries before <strong>any</strong> of their
votes count.</li></ul>

<p>We will implement a number of mechanisms to detect and to eliminate
ballot stuffing, but the honor code applies (see the cheating
section below).</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>Entries will be judged on a 1-5 scale across 4 dimensions:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Utility</strong> - Would you use this again and again?</li><li><strong>Design</strong> - How good does it look and feel to use?</li><li><strong>Innovation</strong> - How original is the idea and execution?</li><li><strong>Completeness</strong> - How "fully baked" is the site? Are there bugs or dead ends?</li></ul>

<h3>Calculation</h3>

<p>A team's score will be determined by adding the expert
judge score and the public score for each dimension.</p>

<p>In addition, there will be a popularity component derived from each entry's
public vote count.</p>

<p>The overall score will be the average of all 5 components
(utility, design, innovation, completeness and popularity).</p>

<h3>Prizes</h3>

<p>There will be the following 7 prize categories:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Overall</strong> - the best overall score</li><li><strong>Solo</strong> - the best overall score for a one-person team</li><li><strong>Utility</strong> - the highest utility score</li><li><strong>Design</strong> - the highest design score</li><li><strong>Innovation</strong> - the highest innovation score</li><li><strong>Completeness</strong> - the highest completeness score</li><li><strong>Popularity</strong> - the entry with the most public votes</li></ul>

<p>A team may only win one prize and will earn the highest prize (in the above
rank order) for which it qualifies, opening its spot in the running for
lower prizes to the next most qualified team.</p>

<h3>Cheating</h3>

<p>This is a competition for fun. The honor code applies: we’re trusting you
to do the honorable thing.</p>

<p>We will be implementing a zero tolerance policy towards cheating.  If you
are provably caught cheating, you will be disqualified immediately, be banned
from all future events, and generally be thought of as a bad person by all of
the organizers and potentially many, many, more people.  Trust us, it's not
worth the risk.</p>

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p>There's no system of voting that will make everybody happy.  Our decisions
are based on lessons from dozens of other competitions and we believe that
they're going to make for a great Knockout.</p>

<p>But it’s important to remember at the end of the day, even if you don’t
win, you’ll still have had a great time, have built something awesome, and
have gotten a ton of exposure for your idea.</p>
